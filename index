For other Google Chrome users like me who are already tired of having to go to the Cisco login page when you connect to the Selor_guest network, I made a Chrome Extension to automate it.
You can install it here: https://github.com/woutervddn/selor-autologin/releases/tag/v.0.1.2

Install instructions:
------------------------

- Download the ext-src.crx file from the link above.
- Visit chrome://extensions/ in your chrome browser
- Drag the downloaded .crx file to the list with installed extensions (an overlay should appear stating that dropping the extension will install it)
- The Selor logo appears in the top right corner of your browser

Configuration instructions:
----------------------------------
You shouldn't put credentials online, so I decided to leave them out and let you guys fill it in (once).

- Right click the Selor login extension on the top right of your browser
- Pick Options
- Enter the username 'selor' and the password: 'selorinternet'
- Press the arrow to save.
- Close this tab
